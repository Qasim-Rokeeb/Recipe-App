# Day 13 - Recipe Finder & Favorites Dashboard 🍲

Welcome to Day 13 of my 30-Day React Relearning Journey!  
Today’s project is a modern **Recipe Finder App** that lets users:

- Search meals by name using TheMealDB API
- View detailed recipes with ingredients and instructions
- Save favorite meals into a persistent list
- Toggle dark mode for better accessibility and user preference
- Enjoy a clean, modern UI with icons and transitions
